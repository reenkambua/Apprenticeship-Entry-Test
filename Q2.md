<!-- Explain how you would optimize a page that loads too slowly. Mention at least three causes and how youâ€™d fix each. -->
Cause	Fix
Large image sizes: Compress and use optimized formats (WebP, lazy loading).
Too many HTTP requests: Combine files (CSS/JS bundling), use CDN, caching.
Unoptimized JavaScript: Minify scripts, defer non-critical JS, use async loading.
